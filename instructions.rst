Description
=================

This fork of the master branch of OVS supports GTP-U tunneling. It takes care only of the mandatory part of the GTP-U tunneling. This tunneling is similar to the other layer 3 tunneling - lisp. Similar to the case with lisp tunneling,  The GTP tunneling code attaches a header with harcoded source and destination MAC address 06:00:00:00:00:00. This address has all bits set to 0, except the locally administered bit, in order to avoid potential collisions with existing allocations. In order for packets to reach their intended destination, the destination MAC address needs to be rewritten.

GTP is a layer 3 tunneling mechanism, meaning that encapsulated packets do not carry Ethernet headers, and ARP requests shouldn't be sent over the tunnel. Because of this, there are some additional steps required for setting up GTP tunnels in Open vSwitch, until support for L3 tunnels will improve. This can be understood from the flow rules given in the following sections.

There is an installation script *install.sh* included in the repository which can automate the installation of OVS on your machine along with the dependencies. Alternatively you can install the dependencies by the following command

``$ apt-get -y install git wget dh-autoreconf libssl-dev libtool libc6-dev``

Before installing OVS ensure that you have python2.7 or any later version installed on your machine (by default python is > 2.7 on Ubuntu 16) and python six module is also installed.If you do not have python six installed, you can install it by the following commands::

	$ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/b3/b2/238e2590826bfdd113244a40d9d3eb26918bd798fc187e2360a8367068db/six-1.10.0.tar.gz#md5=34eed507548117b2ab523ab14b2f8b55
	$ tar -xvf six-1.10.0.tar.gz
	$ cd six-1.10.0
	$ sudo python setup.py install

After the OVS is installed, you can install mininet by the following command. Installing mininet is optional. In my scenario I am using mininet to simulate a virtual topology and demonstrate GTP-U tunneling.

``$ apt-get install mininet``


Setting up the GTP tunneling port on OVS ::
-----------------------------------------

``$ ovs-vsctl add-br br1``

# flow based tunneling port

``$ ovs-vsctl add-port br1 gtp0 -- set interface gtp0 type=gtp options:remote_ip=flow options:key=flow``

or

# port based tunneling port

``$ ovs-vsctl add-port br1 gtp1 -- set interface gtp1 type=gtp options:remote_ip=<IP of the destination> options:key=flow``

Scenario Explanation
--------------------

In the example scenario we have two virtual machines(VM1 & VM2) with mininet installed on both of them. We have
two hosts attached on each of the VMs. VM1 has hosts H1 and H2 and VM2 has hosts H3 and H4. Tunneling is enabled
between H1 and H3 & between H2 and H4.

A mininet topology is also started on each of the VMs using the python script given in the following sections. A *VM#flow.txt* file is also provided which adds the flow rules on each of these VMs. You have to run the corresponding python file to
automatically add the mininet topology and the flows. The script also configures the GTP port on the VMs automatically so that you do not have to explicitly set up GTP ports as explained in the above section. If you look into the files, you can understand the working.

Before adding the topology and GTP port, the VMs should be setup in such a way that you can ping one VM from the other. This you need to setup while configuring your machines. There are youtube videos showing how to connect two VMs and establish ping between them. In this particular scenario VM1 is having an ethernet port eth1 with IP address 192.168.56.101 and VM2 is having an ethernet port eth1 with IP address 192.168.56.103. The VM1 can ping VM2 through the ethernet port eth1 on each of the VMs.


The following python script can be run on VM1 to setup the gtp port and mininet topology::

	from mininet.topo import Topo
	from mininet.net import Mininet
	from mininet.log import setLogLevel, info
	from mininet.node import OVSController, RemoteController,Node
	from mininet.cli import CLI

	class SimplePktSwitch(Topo):
    	"""Simple topology example."""

    		def __init__(self, **opts):
        	"""Create custom topo."""
			import os
			os.system ('sudo mn -c')
        		# Initialize topology
       			# It uses the constructor for the Topo cloass
        		super(SimplePktSwitch, self).__init__(**opts)

       			# Adding hosts and setting IP and MAC addresses
        		h1 = self.addHost('h1', ip='10.0.0.1',mac='00:00:00:00:00:01')
        		h2 = self.addHost('h2', ip='10.0.0.2',mac='00:00:00:00:00:02')

	
        		# Adding switches
        		s1 = self.addSwitch('s1')

       			# Add links
        		self.addLink(h1, s1)
        		self.addLink(h2, s1)

	def run():
    	net = Mininet(topo=SimplePktSwitch(),controller=OVSController)
    	net.start()
    	import os
	# command to setup tunneling port from terminal.
    	os.system ('sudo ovs-vsctl add-port s1 gtp1 -- set interface gtp1 type=gtp option:remote_ip=192.168.56.103 option:key=flow ofport_request=10')
    	os.system ('sudo ovs-ofctl add-flows s1 VM1flow.txt')
    	# following commands are to connect eth1 to the OVS to enable communication between VMs directly
    	os.system ('sudo ovs-vsctl add-port s1 eth1')
    	os.system ('sudo ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0')
    	os.system ('sudo ifconfig s1 192.168.56.101')  	
    
    	CLI(net)
    	net.stop()
	# if the script is run directly (sudo custom/optical.py):
	if __name__ == '__main__':
    	setLogLevel('info')
	run()
